# Valkyrie Game

This is a Shooter/Platformer inspired by Kid Icarus: Uprising. This will be a 2D game, and all code and assets will be created using open source projects.

The design will be split into three segments:

* [Mechanics](Mechanics.md)
* [Levels](Levels.md)
* [Art](Art.md)

Each segment must be completed to specification before moving on to the next.
