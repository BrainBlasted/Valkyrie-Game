    /// Many of the methods accept [code]trans_type[/code] and [code]ease_type[/code]. The first accepts an TRANS_* constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation is handled (you might want to see [code]http://easings.net/[/code] for some examples). The second accepts an EASE_* constant, and controls the where [code]trans_type[/code] is applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you don't know which transision and easing to pick, you can try different TRANS_* constants with EASE_IN_OUT, and use the one that looks best.
