# Valkyrie Game

A repository for an unfinished Kid Icarus inspired game. Forked from  my unfinished [GMTK Jam](https://github.com/BrainBlasted/GMTK-Jam) project.

## Design:
- Scrolling shooter
- Monsters
- The "health" bar is a vigor bar, meaning all actions, like attacking and dashing are tied to it. The more vigor you have, the higher damage your attacks do. To regain vigor, you kill enemies.
- Three levels, one arcade-like, two bosses
	- Levels can be expanded on after jam

## Building:
- Install Godot Engine 3.0 by either building it yourself or from a pre-compiled package
- Import the project
- Export or run the project.
